# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying in React App

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes are not applied correctly in a React application, even though the configuration appears to be correct. The issue lies in the way the build process handles Tailwind directives and the generated CSS output.

## Bug Description

The Tailwind classes are defined in `tailwind.config.js` and imported into the React component. However, they do not render in the browser, and inspecting the network requests shows that the directives are missing from the compiled CSS.  The build process, including the Tailwind CSS plugin configuration, seems to be set up correctly, and there are no error messages in the console.

## Solution

The provided solution demonstrates how to properly configure the build process to ensure that Tailwind's directives are processed and injected into the CSS output, resolving the styling issues. This typically involves ensuring that the Tailwind plugin within the build tool is correctly configured and all necessary build steps are performed.  A common cause is an incorrectly configured build pipeline or a mismatch in the build tool's version and the Tailwind plugin's requirements.
