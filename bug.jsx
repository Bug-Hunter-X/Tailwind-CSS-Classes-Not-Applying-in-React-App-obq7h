I encountered an issue where Tailwind CSS classes weren't being applied correctly in my React application.  The classes were defined correctly in my `tailwind.config.js` file and I was importing them into my component, but the styles weren't rendering.  I checked my browser's developer tools and noticed that the Tailwind directives were not being included in the final CSS output. My build process seemed fine, and there were no apparent errors in the console.
